Description: The aim of this package is to propose several methods for testing
    interactions between genes, and their association with a response variable.
    This study can be done using Snp-Snp Interaction (SSI) methods or Gene-Gene
    Interaction (GGI) methods. The package also proposes a graphic display of
    the results with a Shiny application.
