\title{KCCA (Kernel Canonical-Correlation Analysis) based GGI analysis.}
\usage{
KCCA.test(Y, G1, G2, n.boot = 500)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{numeric or factor vector with two values (most often 0, 1). This is
the response variable and should be of length equal to the number of row of
G1 and G2 arguments (number of individuals).}

\item{G1}{\href{http://bioconductor.org/packages/snpStats/}{SnpMatrix} object.
Must have a number of row equal to Y argument's length.}

\item{G2}{\href{http://bioconductor.org/packages/snpStats/}{SnpMatrix} object.
Must have a number of row equal to Y argument's length.}

\item{n.boot}{integer strictly superior to 0. This is the number of bootstrap
replicates for the variances estimation. By default, this is fixed to 500.}
}
\value{
If the function succeed, it returns the interaction pvalue between G1
 and G2. An error message is displayed if the variances used for the test
 statistic calculus could not be estimated. An error message is shown if the
 test statistic could not be computed.
}
\description{
\code{KCCA.test} performs a Gene-Gene Interaction (GGI) analysis based on the
difference of correlations between case and control. It allows detecting non
linear interaction between 2 genes.
}
\details{
To calculate the test statistic for the interaction pvalue, \code{KCCA.test}
estimate the variances of each group case-control. A bootstrap method is used
to compute these variances. With the maximum of the Kernel version of the
canonical correlations for each group tranformed using an analogy to Fisher's
transformation, the test statistic is computed and represents the
co-association between genes.

Be careful, this function is very long to run. The algorithm is not adapted to
the long duration of the canonical correlations computation with
\code{\link[kernlab]{kcca}.}
